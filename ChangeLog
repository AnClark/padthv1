  dialog, wherever missing.


0.9.0  2018-03-07  The End of Winter'18 release.

- Introducing Scala micro-tuning classes, borrowed, stirred
  and refactored from original Nick Dowell's amsynth code,
  all under the GPL umbrella, of course.
- An internal note-key/frequency indirection table is now in
  place, as a baseline for any micro-tuning implementations.
- Whether to use native file browser/requester dialogs is
  now an effective option when launching under NSM session
  management (was once disabled initially).
- Trying to get CC14 MSB+LSB (course+fine) running status on,
  no matter whether each pairing event are under 200ms apart.
- A little hardening on the configure (autoconf) macro side.


0.8.6  2017-12-20  The End of Autumn'17 release.
