ChangeLog


GIT HEAD

- Make NSM state independent to session display name, keeping
  backward compatibility for old sessions. (EXPERIMENTAL)
- Give some more slack to schedule/worker thread ring-buffer.


0.9.2  2018-07-24  A Summer'18 release.

- Add LV2 UI Resize extension data support.
- Process MIDI Controlllers even though the channel filter
  is on (DEF Channel is set anything but "Omni").
- AppData/AppStream metadata is now settled under an all
  permisssive license (FSFAP).


0.9.1  2018-06-26  An Early Summer'18 release.

- Fixed for some g++ >= 8.1.1 warnings and quietness.
- Added LV2 UI X11 support option.
- Disable reference micro-tuning settings when a Scala
  keyboard map override is in effect.
- Added "All files (*.*)" filter to every file requestor
  dialog, wherever missing.


0.9.0  2018-03-07  The End of Winter'18 release.

- Introducing Scala micro-tuning classes, borrowed, stirred
  and refactored from original Nick Dowell's amsynth code,
  all under the GPL umbrella, of course.
- An internal note-key/frequency indirection table is now in
  place, as a baseline for any micro-tuning implementations.
- Whether to use native file browser/requester dialogs is
  now an effective option when launching under NSM session
  management (was once disabled initially).
- Trying to get CC14 MSB+LSB (course+fine) running status on,
  no matter whether each pairing event are under 200ms apart.
- A little hardening on the configure (autoconf) macro side.


0.8.6  2017-12-20  The End of Autumn'17 release.

- Set on a minimum attack time of 500usec as much to prevent
  audible clicking on low-pitched notes.


0.8.5  2017-10-29  An Autumn'17 release.

- Opening multiple preset files is now possible, populating
  the preset drop-down listing, while only the first one is
  loaded effectively into the scene as usual.
- Mono(phonic) "Legato" mode option introduced.
- Desktop entry specification file is now finally independent
  from all build/configure template chains, whatever.
- Updated target path for freedesktop.org's AppStream metainfo
  file (formerly AppData).


0.8.4  2017-08-22  A Late-Summer'17 release.

- First public release.


0.8.3  2017-07-20  Initial change-log entry.
